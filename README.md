# Quantium Job Simulation – Dash Environment Setup

This repository contains the initial environment setup for the Quantium Job Simulation project.  
The goal of this task is to prepare a clean, reproducible Python development environment for building an interactive data visualisation using the Dash framework.

## Setup Summary
- Python 3.9 virtual environment
- Dependencies managed using `requirements.txt`
- Core libraries installed:
  - Dash (including testing dependencies)
  - Pandas

## Project Structure
- `data/` – Provided CSV datasets for analysis
- `requirements.txt` – Project dependencies
- `.gitignore` – Excludes virtual environment and system files

This repository serves as the foundation for subsequent tasks involving data analysis and interactive dashboard development using Dash.
