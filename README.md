This repository contains the solution for the data processing task in the Quantium Job Simulation.  
The objective of this task is to transform raw transaction data into a clean, structured dataset that can be used for analysis and visualization.

## 📊 Task Overview

Soul Foods provided three CSV files containing transaction-level data for different morsel products sold across regions and dates.  
The business question focuses specifically on **Pink Morsel** sales.

To support further analysis, the raw data is processed to:
- Filter only *Pink Morsel* transactions
- Compute total sales per transaction
- Output a clean, unified dataset

## 🛠️ Data Processing Logic

The processing script performs the following steps:

1. Reads all CSV files from the `data/` directory  
2. Filters rows where the product is **Pink Morsel**  
3. Calculates **Sales = Quantity × Price**  
4. Retains only the required fields:
   - `Sales`
   - `Date`
   - `Region`
5. Writes the processed data to a timestamped CSV file
